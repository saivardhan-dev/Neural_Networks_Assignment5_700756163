# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Assignment -5

### Imported the given datafile and some libraries to do the below questions

### Question 1:
The code preprocesses the dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance requires pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy.Replace df with your dataset's variable name. Ensure the dataset has features and a target column named 'Type' and prints the accuracy of the trained model on the test set and provides a classification report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

### Questiion 2:
Requires pandas and scikit-learn.Replace df with your dataset's variable name. Ensure the dataset has features and a target column named 'Type' and Prints the accuracy of the trained model on the test set and provides a classification report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
